# UrbaNet

Exploring the PlacePulse 2.0 dataset and analyzing the urban safety perception through visual features. [Paper](https://fmorenovr.github.io/documents/papers/conferences/2021_WIIAT.pdf).

# Requirements

- **Python**>=3.12

# Installation
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data

Obtain the Place Pulse 2.0 dataset [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1V1EjMaz-qqSLzMS4f8N-XkUhAUIqLKa7?usp=sharing).

### Data Preparation

* Download images and `pp2_raw_data.zip`.  
* Create a `.env` file, and add the path of the data downloaded and models.  
  ```
    DATA_PATH=/path_to/datasets/
    MODEL_PATH=/path_to/models/
  ```
* First, run the notebook `notebooks/Data/Organize_Information.ipynb`.  
  Second, run the notebook `notebooks/Data/Comparisons_to_Scores.ipynb`.  
  Then, run the notebook `notebooks/Data/Statistics.ipynb`.  

* Train models running `notebooks/Models/Convolutional_Networks.ipynb`.  
  Then, run explanations at `notebooks/Explanations/XAI.ipynb`.  
  Next, extract features at `notebooks/Models/Feature_Extraction.ipynb`.  
  Finally, perform classifier with `notebooks/Models/Linear_Models.ipynb`.
